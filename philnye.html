<p>
PHIL 405/505<br>
Topics in Philosophy of Mind: Intentionality, Subjective Experience, and the Distribution of Consciousness<br>
Dr. Howard Nye - Monday: 14:00 - 16:50<br>
<br>
Do lobsters have subjective experiences? If so, are they anything like our own? What about the artificial intelligence systems, brain-computer interfaces, or androids of the (perhaps not so distant!) future? A key question here may be to what extent these entities are capable of having states with the right sort of intentionality, or capacity to represent the world or have as a goal the alteration of certain aspects of it. In this course we will examine the nature of intentionality, the relationship between intentionality and subjective experience, and what it takes for intentionality and subjective experience to be realized by physical systems. With these theoretical considerations in mind, we will explore whether and to what extent the capacity for subjective experience is present in various non-human animals, very young humans, and humans with disorders of consciousness, as well as what it would take for it to be present in an artificial intelligence system.

<p>
Dear Philosophers all--</br>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past several years there has been a Logic Reading Group in the U of Alberta Philosophy Department.  It has now organized itself (to the degree it ever gets organized!) for this semester.  Our basic program for the fall term will be to work through (as fast or as slowly as it feels the subject matter demands as we go along...) the basic theory of finite automata, Turing machines, and computational complexity, using Michael Sipser's An Introduction to the Theory of Computation.  This is one of the basic areas of mathematical logic, with clear relevance to areas including the philosophy of mind (Can robots think? Well, for a start, just what is a robot...) and the philosophy of language (Spoiler alert: the word grammar and the name Chomsky both appear prominently in early chapters...).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the tradition of the Logic Group is to be open to digressions.  Nic Ferencz has said he would like to take one session in the next few weeks to trial run his paper for the Western Canadian Philosophical Association.  And what we'll do after Sipser... is something we will decide when we get there.  (Something looking at Medieval logic has been suggested...)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meetings will be at 5:00pm Wednesdays, starting next week (Wednesday 18 September), in Room 2-28 Assinniboia unless we outgrow the space.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All are welcome.  For more information, or for a pdf of the chapter of Sipser we are doing next, contact me.<br>
Be well,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allen Hazen (Adjunct Professor (i.e. hanger on), Philosophy Department
